"""Phone push notifications via ntfy.sh.

The poller runs unattended while the user is away from the desk, which is
exactly when a macOS notification is useless.  ntfy delivers to the phone,
needs no account, and its ``Click`` header makes the notification open the job
URL directly.

Set ``NTFY_TOPIC`` to a long random string — anyone who knows the topic can
read your notifications.
